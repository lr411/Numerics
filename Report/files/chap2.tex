\subsection{General results}

\subsubsection{Order of accuracy}
As described in the previous parts of this document, the theoretical order of accuracy of the numerical schemes used is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item FTBS: 1
	\item CTCS: 2
	\item Lax Wendroff: 2
	\item CNCS: 2
\end{itemize}
The following figure \ref{fig:orderofacc} shows the results of the experiment of 10 runs of the 4 schemes, with nt and nx varying between 50 and 500, with a step of 50.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Computational cost}
We have estimated the computational cost timing code execution of the numerical methods and the following is a figure showing the estimated dependency of the order of magnitude of the time taken to execute the code vs nx, details of the experiment will be given in \ref{sec:compcost}. The LaxWendroff method proves to be particularly expensive, whereas the CNCS, although it involves handling matrices, has been the fastest algorithm, most probably thanks to the efficiency of the sparse matrices Python library.

\subsection{Order of accuracy}
To test the order of accuracy, 10 runs have been made of the 4 schemes, keeping the Courant number constant throughout, and varying nx, keeping nt=nx to avoid rounding errors. The function $sin(4\pi x)$ has been used as initial condition, it's smooth and with a single frequency and therefore does not suffer from dispersion errors that could affect the error.
The results of the runs are shown in figure \ref{fig:orderofacc} , and the estimated order of accuracy for the methods is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item FTBS: 0.91
\item CTCS: 1.80
\item CNCS: 1.79
\item LaxWendroff: 1.79
\end{itemize}
The results are close to the theoretical ones.

\subsubsection{Computational cost}
\label{sec:compcost}
We have estimated the computational cost of the various numerical methods, timing code execution with the timeit Python library, that returns the fraction of seconds a code has taken to run, measured between two calls to \texttt{default\_Dist\_timer()}.
To estimate the order of magnitude in the relationship time vs nx, we have used log-log plots, and fitted the resulting curves with a line. In addition to the experiment in figure \ref{fig:timing}, that shows the execution of consecutive runs varying $nx\in [200, 550]$, with a step of 50, we have tried to "push" the system further, with an additional run $nx\in [400, 950]$ with a step of 50, and result remain fairly consistent.
What we have found is that The LaxWendroff and CTCS methods prove to be particularly expensive computationally, with an estimated order 2 of magnitude increase of time wrt nx, whereas the CNCS, although it involves handling matrices, has been the fastest algorithm, with estimated order 1.5, most probably thanks to the efficiency of the sparse matrices Python library.

Results of fit for $nx\in [200, 550]$ (see fig \ref{fig:timing})
\begin{itemize}
	\item FTBS: 1.84
	\item CTCS: 1.94
	\item CNCS: 1.42
	\item LaxWendroff: 2.08
\end{itemize}

Results of fit for $nx\in [400, 950]$ (see fig \ref{fig:timing2})
\begin{itemize}
\item FTBS: 1.89
\item CTCS: 2.00
\item CNCS: 1.57
\item LaxWendroff: 1.98
\end{itemize}
