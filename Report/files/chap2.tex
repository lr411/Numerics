%Chapter CTCS method


The second method to be explored is CTCS. Characteristics of the method can be found in \cite{mpebook}.


\section{General characteristics}
We will explore the characteristics of the CTCSS method.

\subsection{Conservation of mass} \label{conservationctcs}

\subsection{Stability} \label{stabilityctcs}


\subsection{Accuracy}

\subsection{Monotonicity}

\subsection{Dispersion errors}

\subsection{Diffusion errors}

\subsection{Computational modes}
What are these??? I read they refer to nothing specifically, but in general to modes that can be either physical or coming from numerical implementations. Not sure I understood how to compute these.

\subsection{Computational Cost}

\subsection{Variable resolution}
