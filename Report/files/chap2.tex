\subsection{General results}

\subsubsection{Order of accuracy}
As described in the previous parts of this document, the theoretical order of accuracy of the numerical schemes used is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item FTBS: 1
	\item CTCS: 2
	\item Lax Wendroff: 2
	\item CNCS: 2
\end{itemize}
The following figure \ref{fig:orderofacc} shows the results of the experiment of 10 runs of the 4 schemes, with nt and nx varying between 50 and 500, with a step of 50.

\subsection{Order of accuracy}
To test the order of accuracy, 10 runs have been made of the 4 schemes, keeping the Courant number constant throughout, and varying nx, keeping nt=nx to avoid rounding errors. The function $sin(4\pi x)$ has been used as initial condition, it's smooth and with a single frequency and therefore does not suffer from dispersion errors that could affect the error.
The results of the runs are shown in figure \ref{fig:orderofacc} , and the estimated order of accuracy for the methods is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item FTBS: 0.91
\item CTCS: 1.80
\item CNCS: 1.79
\item LaxWendroff: 1.79
\end{itemize}
The results are close to the theoretical ones.
