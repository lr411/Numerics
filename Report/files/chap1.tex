%\chapter{FTBS}


The first method to be explored is FTBS. Characteristics of the method can be found in the book 

The function used for the method is in the file advectionSchemes.py, and the function in the code is the following, with comments included on the meaning of inputs:
\begin{lstlisting}
def FTCS(phiOld, c, nt):    
"Linear advection scheme using FTCS, with Courant number c and"
"                       nt time-steps"
"inputs are:"
"phiOld: initial condition on phi (to save space the array will then"\
"               be used to store values from the previous time step)"
"c: Courant number"
"nt: nr of time steps"
\end{lstlisting}

\section{General characteristics}
We will explore the characteristics of the FTBS method, in terms of
