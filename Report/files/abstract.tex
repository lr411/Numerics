In this work we present the analysis of the linear advection equation modelled in one dimension, x, without sources or sinks of the advected variable $\phi$. The exact expression of the equation is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:linadvec}
\phi_{t}+u\phi_{x}=0
\end{equation}
We consider the case of constant and uniform wind, u, and with given initial condition $\phi(x,0)=\phi_{0}$.
It can be shown that the analytic solution of \ref{eq:linadvecq} is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:linadvec_initcondition}
\phi(x,t)=\phi_{0}(x-ut)
\end{equation}
We have modelled equation \ref{eq:linadvecq} using several numerical schemes:
