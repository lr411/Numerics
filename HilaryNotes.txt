I coded the linear advection equation. The following is my repo on GitHub:

You have received full marks for submitting code for comment and using git. 

Good start solving the linear advection equation

Some of feedback in the file genericFeedback.txt is relevant to you. Here are some comments that are specific to you. You will need to take this feedback into account for your final code submission in order to achieve a good mark.

0. Good that you are making frequent commits with git

1. You should have a .gitignore file

2. Don't include large or binary files in a git repository. These should be automatically excluded by having a .gitignore file. (For example gz or pdf files).

3. You should have a  README file

4. The code for FTBS should say what boundary conditions are being applied

5. You should try to avoid having so much commented out code. Either leave it in because it is useful and you will use it or remove it. You will always be able to get it back because you are using version control.
