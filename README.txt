# # Numerical analysis for advection scheme
# # The following files are included
# # initialConditions.py : initial condition
# # advectionSchemes.py : functions with advection schemes
# # diagnostics.py : diagnostics functions
# # linearAdvect.py : this file
#         
# We assume that time t varies in [0,1] and x varies in [0,1]        
# This file, when launched, calls the routine runLinAdvec that performs tests
