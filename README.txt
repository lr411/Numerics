Numerical implementation of the linear advection equation.

The implementation consists of 4 files:• linearAdvect.py: main file used to run the project• initialConditions.py: initial condition file, stores different possible choices of initial conditions thatcan be used to test different properties• linearAdvect.py: advection schemes file• diagnostics.py: diagnostics functions file
