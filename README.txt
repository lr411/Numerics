Please run the main file linearAdvect.py to run the project

# # Numerical analysis for advection scheme
# # The following files are included
# # initialConditions.py : initial condition
# # advectionSchemes.py : functions with advection schemes
# # diagnostics.py : diagnostics functions
# # linearAdvect.py : main file
#         
# We assume that time t varies in [0,1] and x varies in [0,1]        
# linearAdvect.py, when launched, calls the routine main twice,
# running the numerical schemes and plotting the results vs the exact
# solution, for two different time steps.
# Then the order of convergence is checked calling the routine runErrorTests
