Overall mark for code - 13/15

You have responded well to most of the feedback - 5/5

You still shouldn't have .png files in the repository

Well structured, correct, clear, well commented code - 8/10


The code says:
# the following is included because otherwise the first time I run\
# the code gives an error
import pylab as py

Well yes, you use pylab!

You justify your use of append by saying that it is less error prone. I disagree if you structure your code well. For example you could use:

schemes = ["FTBS", "CTCS", "FTCS"]
nSchemes = len(schemes)
errors = np.zeros(nSchemes)
for i in range(nSchemes):
    errors[i] = ...

My technique would also avoid a lot of code duplication that you have in linearAdvect.py

Great to use sparse matrices.
