Good start but it looks as if you have a long way to go.

Use latex article documentclass rather than report. You don't need a title page, chapters, abstract or table of contents. 

You need to consider a better scheme than FTBS and CTCS. Look in chapter 6 of the lecture notes for ideas. 

The initial conditions should be included in the experiment description, not in the description of FTBS. 

You do not need to consider so many numerical properties. 

The point of this assignment is comparison of schemes so consider your chosen numerical properties with respect to all the numerical methods together. 

Define all schemes in full before you present results. 

Before you present results, define all experiments and simulations in full, giving enough information so that someone else could reproduce your results with their code and without reference to your code.

Figure 1.1 does not show you that FTBS is first-order accurate, it shows you that FTBS is diffusive. In order to find the order of convergence of a scheme you need to run it with different resolutions (note, keep the Courant number and the total simulation constant when you vary dx and dt together).

The numbers that you present in equations 1.3 and 1.4 are not useful. These should be presented in a graph for various values of dx and for all schemes together, showing order of convergence.

I would avoid trying to find evidence of computational modes in your results.

In order to calculate computational cost, you can use various functions in Python to time your code. 

Don't include your code in your report.

Variable resolution means that dx is not uniform in space. I wouldn't recommend doing this.

Omit chapter 3
